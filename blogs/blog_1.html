			<h1 class="blog-h1">"The Last Of Us" Best Games Of All Time</h1>

			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				If you haven't played "
				<a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-in/games/the-last-of-us-remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>The last of us</a
				>
				" or any story-driven games in general you will be so confused about what am I talking about. The Last of Us is a game that was
				released in 2014, it comes under the action-adventure genre, and was developed by
				<a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Naughty Dog</a> . Let me tell you why this game will
				always be my best game of all time without giving spoilers if anyone wants to try it out.
			</p>

			<h3>Gameplay</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				The whole game is set in the post-apocalyptic world. where there is an infection that converts any living being into a mindless
				zombie. This creates a constant fear in the player's head, any wrong step and you will be turned into a zombie. You play as
				<a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Joel_Miller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Joel</a>. Who does not have a
				good life in this world("not trying to spoil it for anyone"). After the prologue, you are introduced to the character
				<a href="https://thelastofus.fandom.com/wiki/Ellie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Ellie</a>. The second most important
				character of the game. You as a player given a task to escort Ellie across the United States. While the lockdown is still in place you
				have to escort this little girl who is 14 years old to a group called Fireflies. while taking her to places, you bond with the
				14-year-old, you see your daughter in her you had. You laugh, You cry, You get scared of the zombies not only Joel, but the player who
				is controlling feels every single emotion these characters go through because of how beautifully this game is narrated and directed.
			</p>

			<h3>Environment</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				This game
				<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/naughty_dog/albums/72157628351324573/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>visually exceeds my expectation</a
				>
				. I still cannot believe that this was the game Naughty Dog made in 2013. If you look at the environment it is exactly how a
				post-apocalyptic world would look like. The broken building walls, wild grass everywhere, broken sewage systems, collapsed bridges,
				All cars are broken stolen batteries by the survivors, bobby traps placed by survivors for the zombies, and lots more which will make
				you wait and look at the environment. Some places are so dense and filled with zombies that creates a claustrophobic effect for the
				player to get out of that area. On the other hand, you have large open areas that give the player feeling of loneliness or void to
				think what is the point of doing anything when more than half the world is infected.
			</p>

			<h3>Combat</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				The combat in this game is really good. You have 2 options melee or gunfight. Very little game that nails the melee fight but this
				game excels in this too. You feel every punch you hit you. For melee or gunfight, you need supplies but in this world, the supplies
				are very limited, because of which players have to make quick decisions, strategies, and play. This immerses you more than anything in
				the games
			</p>

			<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p class="blog-p">
				There was a lot to talk about this game but, This is how far I can go without spoiling the game for anyone. If you have never played
				any game in your life I highly recommend you start your gaming journey with this one. After this game, I have played a lot of games
				but this game will always be in my top 3. <br />
