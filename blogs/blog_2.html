			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				When I was a little kid I used to play a lot of video games. I mean I still do but it's way less now. Video games have always been
				close to me. They always made me think how are they made, how every part of a video games works.Then I met this one game called
				<a href="https://www.minecraft.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Minecraft</a> . Minecraft is a sandbox game which means
				you can do anything you want in this game. You can write some commands to make things happen it has logic gates,command block,
				conditional statements. Then I was introduced to the concept of coding.
			</p>

			<h3>Game Development</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				To make my own game I needed to learn a programming language with software like
				<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unreal engine</a> or
				<a href="https://unity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unity</a> . So I picked up
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_Sharp_(programming_language)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> C#</a> with unity
				because there were a lot of tutorials available for it. After hundreds of tutorials hundreds of crashes, I made
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zoefgames.BOI2D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>my first mobile game</a
				>
				. I was happy I was filled with energy but after some time and projects, it was clear to me that my current hardware won't let me keep
				up with game development. I had to choose to change the hardware or to change the track at that time changing hardware was next to
				impossible and I didn't want my passion for coding which I picked up over the years to die down just because of my hardware so I
				changed my track.

			<h3>Flutter Mobile App Development</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				When I was looking for other alternatives I saw that I could try android development, but learning android development I had to choose
				a language there was java or kotlin, but if in the future I decided that I wanted to work for an ios app. Then I would have to learn
				Objective C or Swift. Which was a challenge in itself to pick one. Searching for the solution I came across
				<a href="https://flutter.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">flutter</a>. I learned dart programming language. Now I can
				build
				<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8237467912176058925" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
					>a flutter app on my own</a
				>
				, but as flutter is new and is still progressing day by day opportunities are still far less. To look for this solution I finally made
				my mind to do web development.
			</p>

			<h3>Web Development</h3>
			<p class="blog-p">
				Making a transition from flutter to web is not that difficult as these two are kind of the same as flutter uses dart which is also
				used to make web apps. One good friend of my mine suggested me neogcamp which also made the whole transition to web development a lot
				easier for me there is still a lot to learn and explore.
